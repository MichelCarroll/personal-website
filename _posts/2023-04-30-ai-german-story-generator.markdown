I'm working on a proof of concept for a second-langauge learning application. The project's main thesis is that existing language-learning apps tend to teach concepts in isolation, which makes it hard to bridge the gap between beginner material and reading content in the wild. In addition, learning words in context is much more effective for retention than memorizing words in the void. 

Using myself as a guinea pig, my goal is to leverage generative AI and German frequency lists to improve my reading comprehension through generating short stories in German, along with a full translation and a vocabulary list.
