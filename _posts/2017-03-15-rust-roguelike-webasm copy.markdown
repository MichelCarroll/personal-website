I wrote a small [roguelike game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) prototype in Scala, leveraging [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) to render it in the browser.

My motivations for building this were:
- To gain a better mastery of the Scala programming language
- For fun and as a tribute to the roguelike game genre ðŸ˜Š
