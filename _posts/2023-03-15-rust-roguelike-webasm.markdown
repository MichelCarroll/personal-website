I wrote a small [roguelike game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) prototype in Rust. It uses ECS to coordinate the various game components and systems, leveraging the [specs](https://github.com/amethyst/specs) crate. In order to make it more easily accessible and shareable, I target WebAssembly to run it in the browser.

My motivations for building this were:
- To gain a better mastery of the Rust ðŸ¦€ programming language, WebAssembly, and their ecosystems
- As a proof of concept for more complex data-driven and browser-based roguelike games
- As a tribute to the roguelike game genre
- For fun, of course ðŸ˜Š
