I led the design and development of an AI agent for an original turn-based game called "Colosseum Survival" in the context of my McGill AI coursework. I used the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) and [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) algorithms and resorted to several custom heuristic functions in order to account for the huge search space and time constraints imposed on the design.

The agent reported an almost perfect (99.8%) success rate against random opponents.
