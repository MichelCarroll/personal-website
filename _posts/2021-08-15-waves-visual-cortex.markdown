I conducted some independent research on [local field potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_field_potential) data while in the [Khadra lab](https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/khadralab/) during my McGill undergradute degree. I used [optical flow analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow) and [phase coherence analysis](https://www.everythingrf.com/community/what-is-phase-coherence) to find spatiotemporal patterns that might help explain mechanisms behind saccades in primates.

I primarily used Python and Jupyter notebooks, as well as [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) to run heavy computations.
