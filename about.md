<p>I have 12 years of experience working with software across various business domains including smart textiles, chatbots, gaming, master data management, and healthcare. I hold a BSc from McGill University in computer science and biology. Currently, I'm passionate about natural-language processing, artificial intelligence, and knowledge graphs. Most recently, I've been tinkering a lot with large language models.</p>

<p>Python, Scala, Rust, Typescript are fully in my wheelhouse, and have a strong command of AWS and Terraform. I have a product-oriented mindset, the ability to think strategically, as well as exceptional communication and execution skills.</p>
